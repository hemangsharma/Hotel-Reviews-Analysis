Facilities are clean and new and never a problem with the showers unlike other one or two hostels in other areas, where taps are broken or hard to adjust water temperature.
The bed mattress on the beds are soft and comfortable.
Totally pest free which means it is cleaned well 
This building is well maintained under good and remarkable management and staff

She was continuously saying it’s “ridiculous”.  So as we had paid $174 for the night, therefore, 174/6=29. We had paid $29 for each person.

3. Since you told us you have young children and it's already late at night, our reception made an exception to only charge for your parking on your night day check out. And the next day you refused to pay for the car park of $25 because you said we didn't give you what you want.

Are you serious!!?! That was NOT on the booking information or part of my contract checking in. If I book a room with a private bathroom I expect to be able to get ready in it.

Also the guy in the reception, no eye contact, no hi when you arrive etc. You end up feeling like a ghost. That was fine... He did try and be nice in the end but it all felt really weird.

What wasn't fine was the other guy who I don't believe is the owner shoving my 10 year old daughter out the way and blasting 'move!!!' At her while she was waiting outside reception for somebody to arrive and check us in. Plenty of room to move around a young girl, totally inappropriate and rude to speak to a child like this who was standing there patiently with more respect than this man could ever have. I told him I wasn't going to proceed with thr booking and wanted a refund because I will not have my child spoken to like that and he got argumentative about ne cancelling. That was after I kindly told him that no way to speak to a little girl you should probably apologise. No apology just more rudeness. Some kind of unacceptable grump not related to us but I tell you one thing he's lucky my partner was not there to see it.

Also the entry upstairs looks like a prison with ugly bars, just not family friendly at all I would never bring kids here, we couldn't enjoy the room because we didn't want to disturb anyone even with the TV down low, couldn't use the hair dryer and despite advertising it there was no wifi so I couldn't do anything I needed to do at night time while the children slept.

Really not hard to make this place or the stay a little better. I hope management read this and up their welcoming skills, a slightly harder shove and yes I would have called the police in and pressed assault charges.","4","2.5","10.0","7.5","2.5","7.5","5.0","First we refute the allegation of shoving of your daughter.
